Eggdrop Eliza Extension
==============================================================================

** Requirements
- Linux or Unix System
- Eggdrop 1.6.13 or newer
- Perl 5.6.0 or newer
- LWP::UserAgent Perl Module

** Installation
I assume that your system meets the requirements mentioned above. You must
have a working Eggdrop and access to Perl. Unpack the distribution.
Edit the file eliza.tcl and edit the lines between ###CONFIGSTART###
and ###CONFIGEND###. Then add a line like the following to your Eggdrop
configuration file:
source "/path/to/script/shout.tcl"
Mention the full path to the script file. Rehash your Eggdrop and you are
done.
